This project focuses on developing a recommender system to assist restaurant managers in finding the most suitable location for opening a coffee shop. The system aims to identify the popular and well-known areas within a specific city or region.

### Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to create a recommender system that provides recommendations for the best location to open a coffee shop. To achieve this, the system will consider factors such as geographical coordinates, neighborhood population, demographic information, the average income of residents, food preferences, and availability of other services such as juice bars, transportation facilities, and taxis.

### Target Audience
The target audience for this recommender system includes managers or individuals interested in opening a coffee shop in a particular city or area. These individuals are seeking guidance on identifying the most popular and well-known areas within the city to maximize the chances of business success.

### Data Collection:
To gather the necessary data for this project, several sources were utilized, including:

- Geographical coordinates of the area: Obtained from various mapping services or APIs to identify the latitude and longitude of specific locations.

- Neighborhood population: Data on population counts for different neighborhoods were collected from reliable sources such as census reports or government websites.

- Demographic information: Information about the type of people residing in each neighborhood was gathered. This could include age groups, income levels, education levels, and other relevant demographic factors.

- The average income of the people nearby: Income data for residents in the vicinity of each neighborhood were collected to understand the purchasing power and economic status of the area.

- Food preferences: Data regarding the preferred types of food in each neighborhood was collected. This information could be obtained from surveys, online reviews, or food-related websites.

- Other service details: Additional information about services such as juice bars, transportation facilities, taxis, and other amenities was obtained from various sources, including online directories, API integrations, and public datasets.

The data collection process involved gathering information from diverse sources, including websites such as Wikipedia, Foursquare API, census report websites, and CSV data. By leveraging these data sources, the recommender system can provide comprehensive insights to assist coffee shop managers in making informed decisions regarding the optimal location for their business.

### Recommendation
By analyzing nearby venues, we can conclude that cluster 1  does not have many Coffee shops in that	area. Thus, it  would be suitable to select these locations for opening ice  cream shops.
Therefore, locations like Central Bay Street, Riverdale, The  Beaches West, Commerce Court will be good to open a new Ice  Cream Shop.
